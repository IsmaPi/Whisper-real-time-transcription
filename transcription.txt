HelloThat's a nice considering. question, too. Like if you plug in the HDMI it's just gonna mess up the microphone. I don't think so. I don't think so. I mean if they're not connected  the mic will not be sound system as I have a recommendation for... the way that we pitch our... Okay steps into developing. this product and these are the The week this is done. to develop it further. and immediately I this we tackle but it's way more agile. than we're using a... carefully down from the most curtsy. I won't ever. You know what? You know. And that is how we're important for the and become way more scalable for just people. spent way more time in to develop more. I would say that We can do that on. of how momentum we can take. Okay, there's just... ienseness to his use. If you want to use this we can send it to you but you have to develop it to the point that you can actually use it. like make sure that they know that okay I assume that it's gonna work. There is an easier way. immediately tackling with the strength. What are they gonna do? externalize it Make sure that words We can just slide them that we made a grid. You can guess like these two. to believing, you know, that and then big drugs. Exactly. Yeah, cool though. Thank you guys.  They're a legend.  for a for a start of the We'll go and hold you. Okay Okay, so it... Actually, it's funny. I always love to see this. the description because it's like I read it and I was like whoops whoops whoops I'm gonna be there at this very, you know, moment. I'm gonna speak in bogey. Like, I... I can be there. Okay, whoever is on stage speaking at that time when this is up what you're gonna say is very important because it's gonna be actual proof of concept. We can record the transcript for the entire presentation technically. Actually this has been working since the entire... Guess I know that's why we need to hear your presentations. OK. Here's the transcript. I was like, it's so signature. There's that look you have all the transcription here and then at the end we can like Exactly! Yeah. That's a great idea. If we record it, we can... the end show like the of us starting the presentation and  ore in real time right? Yeah. Like, are we jammed? Is that, is that, is your computer going to be able to take that? Take what? Like if you record it and then it gives it to a like it up. puts it to a file. And then we saw like, yeah. Actually, we have been recording this time. And uh... Yeah, like it has been. working. We just have this running in the background.  Yeah, make sure it works. Yeah, yeah. We need to. Yeah. to make sure it works. connection for all any of this. Yes, it means yes. It's a little bit un... Yeah, what is... Yeah, that's my idea like for our demo this Like yeah, we've been running it the whole time. This is dr- for the presentation and as you can see like it's updating as we speak. Because I wouldn't say that I'm just going to... The weakest. blink here is that so Yeah I can connect it to my phone. but if that works I'm gonna show you, I'm gonna show you I mean, I think it's... A lot more on my own equipment. But I usually go out there... I don't realize. I don't trust your... I don't trust your- anybody you know but my own stuff Nothing wrong with that, always. little piece of it but there shouldn't be a problem because the like the whisper is running locally it's not like connected to the internet right so yeah so we don't need the internet we only need it technically with But no to access the website access it locally. Also, look at that. But it's faster on the web. You click on your right. I don't think so. Like if we're opening the server from the... No, that is gonna be in the server local. Yeah, but they have like the whole... Like it is fast.  Absolutely. No interconnection needed. That's the best scenario. Like it works just... говорю working with the model through a server it's gonna be a potential part but anything else not like yeah no we're not gonna upload it right now we're gonna be recording the entire presentation No, we're not reclaimed. Huh? No, but I mean- No, I'm talking like- I mean it's just have it running in the background. Exactly. So, not recorded. but it's transcribed. like putting the bucket on a server is faster, but like... I think that's beautiful. Right now the front of the 12-matter. It's like, and by the. way we've been recording this entire presentation so that transcribing the entire representation so that you not only have the power PowerPoint but you also have the transcription every single word that we said. Even Frankie's- My arms. And my arms. This is like the one more thing No, I've never heard it. Speed is team is I think his name is just... Uh, his name is Steven.  and PD not even. ★ He can be, he can be, he can be stern in my language and... Step on. Step on. Step on. send a message to our sponsor.
